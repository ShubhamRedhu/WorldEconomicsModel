Reason why Version 1.0 failed - 
If I want to create a simulation to test hypotheses, cash flow appears to be a critical component. The idea is that if we aim to create a real-life scenario of an economy, every country must have its own currency, and this model would not work because:

    1. You cannot track the movement of money.
    2. It is complex to develop relationships between two or more sectors.
    3. You cannot explain the fluctuating prices of money and commodities.
